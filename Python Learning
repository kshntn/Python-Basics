Basics:

Exponentiation: **. This operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right. For example 4**2 will give 16.

Modulo: %. This operator returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right. For example 18 % 7 equals 4.

Variable Assignment:  To create a variable use =


variable types:
int, or integer: a number without a fractional part.
float, or floating point: a number that has both an integer and fractional part, separated by a point. 
str, or string: a type to represent text. You can use single or double quotes to build a string.
bool, or boolean: a type to represent logical values. Can only be True or False


Type conversion:
Use the + operator to paste together two strings.
 	to convert a value into a string. str(variable_name). Similar functions such as int(), float() and bool() will help you convert Python values into any type.


List:
As opposed to int, bool etc., a list is a compound data type; you can group values together:

a = "is"
b = "nice"
my_list = ["my", "list", a, b]

A list can contain any Python type. But a list itself is also a Python type. That means that a list can also contain a list! 
my_list = [el1, el2, el3]

house = [["hallway", hall],
         ["kitchen", kit],
         ["living room", liv],
         ["bedroom",bed],
         ["bathroom",bath]]


 can also use negative indexing.
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
x[1]
x[-3] # same result!


It's possible to slice your list, which means selecting multiple elements from your list.
my_list[start:end]
The start index will be included, while the end index is not.
If you don't specify the begin index, Python figures out that you want to start your slice at the beginning of your list. If you don't specify the end index, the slice will go all the way to the last element of your list.
x[:2]   means from 0 to 1
x[2:]	means from 2 to end
x[:]	all

Subsetting lists of lists
x = [["a", "b", "c"],
     ["d", "e", "f"],
     ["g", "h", "i"]]
x[2][0]
x[2][:2]
x[2] results in a list, that you can subset again by adding additional square brackets.

Replace list elements
Subset the list and assign new values to the subset.
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
x[1] = "r"
x[2:] = ["s", "t"]

Extend a list
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
y = x + ["e", "f"]

Delete list elements
you can also remove elements from your list. You can do this with the del statement:
x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
del(x[1])

Copying the list
You can do this with list() or by using [:]
